Feature Selection Problem: A Novel Hybrid Nature-Inspired Algorithm

Feature Selection (FS) reduces the dimensionality of the feature space, enables performance enhancement of the classifier and reduces the computational complexity of a method. For any \(\mathcal{N}\) features in a dataset, there exist \(\mathcal{R}\) optimal features where $\mathcal{R}<\mathcal{N}$, and classifying with \(\mathcal{R}\) features yields better performance of the classification model. The hybrid and non-hybrid Nature-Inspired (NI) algorithms utilised for FS use suboptimal values of \(\mathcal{R}\), which must be estimated as consistent and optimal to harness the best performance of these models. To address this issue, the presented work proposes a novel algorithm where the hybridisation of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Flower Pollination Algorithms (FPA) has been successfully done. The GA initiates the population by randomly generating features, while the optimal number of features is determined by the FPA. Moreover, FPA offers the appropriate selection of features by employing a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) model to ascertain the fitness value. When compared with the current state-of-the-art, the experimental results confirm the superiority and accuracy of the proposed model in selecting the optimal subset of features. The proposed hybridisation technique outperforms all considered NI algorithms for the investigated datasets in all but one dataset.
